# Revenue Insights Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel revenue data for **AtliQ Hospitality** using **Power BI**. The goal was to gain actionable insights into revenue, occupancy, ratings, and pricing strategies, as well as to identify areas of improvement for underperforming properties.

## Project Objectives
1. **Understand Revenue Trends:** Analyze key metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy, and Realization percentages.
2. **Evaluate Pricing Strategy:** Check if dynamic pricing strategies were applied across weekdays and weekends.
3. **Investigate Ratings and Occupancy:** Identify correlations between low occupancy rates and guest ratings to suggest improvements.
4. **Create an Interactive Dashboard:** Develop a Power BI dashboard to enable stakeholders to explore the data interactively.

## Methodology
### Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process
The entire ETL process was carried out in **Power BI**, which included:
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed inconsistencies, missing values, and ensured data accuracy.
- **Data Transformation:** Converted raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis using Power Query.
- **Data Modeling:** Created relationships between tables for seamless analysis.
- **Visualization:** Built an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

### Key Metrics Analyzed
- **Revenue:** Total earnings across properties.
- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** A key performance indicator combining occupancy and ADR.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Average revenue generated per occupied room.
- **Occupancy:** The percentage of rooms occupied.
- **Realization Percentage:** Revenue realization compared to expected targets.
- **Average Ratings:** Guest feedback for each property.

## Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize the data and uncover insights. Below is a snapshot of the dashboard:

The dashboard allows filtering by:
- City
- Room Class
- Date Ranges (Weekly or Monthly)

Key visualizations include:
- Revenue trends by category (Luxury vs. Business).
- Occupancy, RevPAR, and ADR trends over time.
- Realization percentages by booking platforms.
- Comparative analysis of properties by revenue, bookings, and ratings.

## Insights and Conclusions
### Level 1 Insights
1. **Pricing Strategy:**
   - Pricing remained consistent across weekdays and weekends, indicating the absence of a dynamic pricing strategy.
   - This approach missed potential revenue opportunities during peak periods.

2. **Occupancy Rates:**
   - Weekday occupancy was lower compared to weekends, suggesting a stronger focus on business travelers.

### Level 2 Insights
1. **Correlation Between Ratings and Occupancy:**
   - Properties with lower occupancy rates also had lower average ratings.
   - This suggests that guest satisfaction (as reflected in ratings) directly impacts occupancy.

2. **Operational Recommendations:**
   - Investigate properties with low ratings to identify service or operational inefficiencies.
   - Focus on improving guest experience and addressing specific complaints to enhance ratings and occupancy.

### Recommendations
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Introduce dynamic pricing strategies to capitalize on higher demand during weekends and peak seasons.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Use guest reviews to identify pain points and implement targeted improvements.
- **Marketing Focus:** Develop tailored marketing strategies to promote underperforming properties and increase occupancy.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI:** For data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization.
